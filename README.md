# King of Soccer

King of soccer is an soccer themed interactive story where the underdogs RAZOR SHARP UNITED reach the finals of the champions cup. Decisions, decisions, decision! Whether to pass or shoot will have a major impact on how the tournament plays out. This game is heavily influenced by the NES classic TECMO CUP SOCCER GAME (1992). This is just a snippet of that game's mechanics, and uses many assets from that game. Built on ReactJS.
